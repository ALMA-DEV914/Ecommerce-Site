## My Tasks on this Challenge
Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

My challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I will take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

I am required to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.

## TOOLS and Software
* NODE Packages:
* MySQL2, Express, Sequelize and dotenv
* JAVASCRIPT
* HEROKU ADD-ONS
